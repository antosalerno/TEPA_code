<p>Bioinformatics analyses are carried out to examine data resulting from a BD Rhapsody&trade; single-cell and a subsequent Nanostring GeoMx<sup style="font-size: 10px;">&reg;</sup> Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) experiment.</p>
<p>The R scripts are classified by project (S = single-cell; N = Nanostring) and by their order on the pipeline for that specific project.</p>
<p>If you wish to reproduce the analysis, you can access the single-cell counts and the GeoMx data here :&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10685536.</p>
